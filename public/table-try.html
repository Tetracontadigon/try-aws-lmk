Paid for by Jared Isaacman, the Inspiration4 mission is a charity fundraiser for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, with the goal of raising $200 million to help research and fight childhood cancer; to reach this goal, Isaacman is personally donating $100 million. The four person crew is comprised of four civilians, who have never been to space before." - Trevor Sensic.</p>
