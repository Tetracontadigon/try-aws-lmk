      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

<p>Acadia National Park is located in Maine. Over the summer, the weather is nice, and there are nice hiking locations. The flora and fauna are diverse. One can cool off in the freshwater streams or the sea. The waters are very clear and produce calming sounds. A nice aspect of the park is the fact that there are beaches in addition to forest areas. Pine trees are very common and the greenery comes in many shades. Another nice aspect of Maine is the seafood including lobster. The blueberries are large and have a combination of a sweet and sour flavor, that is just right. Overall, Acadia National Park is a recommended place for a summer vacation due to the various peaceful and scenic areas.</p>
